      <head>Administrative History</head>
      <p>The Hispanic Women's Network of Texas is a non-profit, state-wide organization formed in 1986 which seeks to address issues unique to the Hispanic population in Texas. The Hispanic Women's Network of Texas (HWNT) works to advance the educational, cultural, social, legal, and economic well-being of all women through a broader awareness of their role in society, business, and family. Members strive to celebrate the positive image and values of the Hispanic culture. Members of the HWNT advocate for Hispanic women in all aspects of life, from supporting Hispanic business women through partnerships with Texas Association of Mexican American Chambers Commerce (TAMACC), providing scholarships to Latina students, and hosting freedom marches. Among its founding women were Martha Hinojosa-Nadler, Lena Guerrero, Amalia Rodriguez-Mendoza, Mary Alice Cisneros, Christine Hernandez, and Lupe Ochoa.</p>
      <p>The organization is headquartered in Austin, Texas and currently (as of 2022) has chapters in Austin, Corpus Christi, Dallas, El Paso, Fort Worth, Houston, the Rio Grande Valley, and San Antonio. The HWNT previously had chapters in Denton, Lubbock, and McAllen.</p>
      <p>The HWNT has an organization-wide Board of Directors with positions including the State Chair, Treasurer, Education Chair, and State Membership Chair. Local chapters have their own organizational structure, host their own events, and each chapter has a State Representative that sits on the Board of Directors.</p>
      <p>The HWNT’s largest event is the annual State Conference, which takes place in a different Texas city each year. The conference includes networking, community building, and career advancement opportunities for Latinas across Texas.</p>
      <p>The organization also plans events including annual board retreats; Plat&#xed;cas Poderosas, a lecture series; The Estrella Awards, which honors members of the HWNT that have made an outstanding impact in their communities; and the Latinas in Progress Education Program, which assists Latinas with the transition from high school to higher education.</p>

      <p>Part 3: Additions</p>
	    <p>The materials in Part 3 of the Hispanic Women’s Network of Texas collection, 1987-2019, were created and received by HWNT members as they held state and local meetings, planned and attended annual conferences, and advocated for Hispanic women in the state of Texas. The materials in this addition to the collection consist of minutes and agendas from quarterly state board meetings, invoices from events, published materials about the Latina experience in Texas and the United States, and statements on political issues.</p>  
	    <p>While there are some materials from the local chapters located throughout the state of Texas (including the Austin chapter), the majority of the materials in Part 3 are those compiled by specific state board members (Guadalupe Morin, Dora Trinidad, Cecilia McKay, and Carla Romero) and consist primarily of  materials from state board meetings and annual conference planning. The collection contains materials from the founding of HWNT in 1987 to 2019. The material is consistently spread between these dates, although the late 2000s and early 2010s have the least amount of material.</p>
